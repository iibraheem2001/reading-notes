# Django Forms

* the "Form" class is Django's form handling system. you are able to change and modify every aspect of the form directly from the form. 

### Declaring a form

* The declaration of a form is very similar to declaring a model. It shares the same field types.

* Form data is stored in an application's forms.py file.

* To create a new form. We need to import "forms" library.

### ModelForms

* creating a form class using the the standard approach is very flexible. However, if you just need a form to map the fields of a single model then your model will already define most of the information.

# What does growth mindset mean to me?

Growth mindset is the understanding and fulfilment of making more progress everyday. I plan to grow wiser and gain knowledge everyday.

## 3 reminders to keep me in a growth mindset

1. Write down personal goals that I plan to achive at the end of the day.
2. watch motivational videos on YouTube
3. Plan out my day in advance.

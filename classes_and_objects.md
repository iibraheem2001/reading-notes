# Classes and Objects

### what is an object?

- it is a set of variables and functions merged into a single thing.

- Objects get their values from classes.

### what is a class?

- a class is a template to creating objects and functions.


## Notes:

* a class can contain multiple objects.

* each object must contain an independent copy of their values and must be different from other objects.

* init(): init is called when a class is being initiated.

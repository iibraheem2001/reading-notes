## Queries with constraints

- to filter certain results from being returned, we can use the WHERE clause.
- WHERE clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determune whether it should be included in the results or not.

## What is Schema?

- the database schema is what describes the structure of each table and the datatype that each column on the table can contain.

- when inserting data into a database we need to use an INSERT statement which declares which table to write into.

### Updating Rows:

- the statement UPDATE is similar to the statement INSTERT. UPDATE allows a user to update data in columns and rows.

- Same thing applies for deleting rows. Just use the DELETE statement.

# Encrypting a message

## Ceasar Cipher

- The Caesar Cipher was invented by Julius Caesar. Ut us a cipher which replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the letters by a certain amount.

### Decrypting a message

- Caesar always used a shift of 3. As long as the receiving end knew the shift amount it would be easy to work backwards to decrypt the message.

### Brute force

- There are only 25 possible shifts.

___

## Summary:

- Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift).

- Decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.

- Code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.

# Testing

1. Arrange, Act and Assert

- Arrange: arraning data the correct way for a piece of code to work.

- Act: act is executing that same line(s) of code we arranged in the pervious step.

- Assert: asserting is making sure the output of the code is what was expected.

# name = main

1. Python sets the main program as name.

2. Why? by identifying the name as main it keeps the program from being confused with other peices of code as it would only have that specific name to a certain program.
